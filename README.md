# odin-recipes
Hello!
This project involves creating a basic recipe website which includes a main index page as well as several links
directing the users to several recipes. The main goal is to practice the HTML skills I have acquired over the past few lessons including
creating directories, perfecting boilerplates, adding headings, paragraphs, links and images.
