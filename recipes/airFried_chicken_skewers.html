    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>These Air Fried Chicken Skewers are a quick and easy way to enjoy juicy, flavorful chicken with a crispy, golden exterior. Marinated in a blend of herbs and spices, the chicken 
       is threaded onto skewers and cooked in the air fryer for a healthier, faster alternative to traditional grilling. Perfect for a weeknight dinner or as a party appetizer, these 
       skewers are packed with flavor and require minimal cleanup. Serve them with a side of dipping sauce or your favorite veggies for a complete meal!</p>

     <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
     <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 Pounds chicken Thighs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tsp ginger paste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tsp chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp 7 spice</li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp chili flakes</li>
     </ul>

     <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
     <ol>
        <li>To a bowl, add the cubed chicken along with lemon juice, tomato paste, olive oil, salt, garlic, ginger, yogurt, chili powder, 7 spice, coriander, and chili flakes. Mix together 
            and if you have the time let it marinate from 30 minutes up to overnight.</li>
        <li>After marinating, thread the chicken pieces onto skewers. If using wooden skewers, make sure they have soaked in water for 30 minutes to prevent them from burning. I like to add about 
            6 to 7 pieces onto each skewer.</li>
        <li>Add the skewers to the air fryer and air fry for about 6 to 8 minutes at 400Â°F. Rotate the skewers and air fry again for about 6 to 8 minutes so both sides are golden!</li>
        <li>Turn off the air fryer and keep it open so the skewers stop cooking.</li>
        <li>Over an open flame, add a piece of coal and cook it until it's white all over.</li>
        <li>Transfer the coal to a piece of foil shaped into a small bowl and add it to air fryer. Drizzle a small amount of olive oil onto the coal so it starts smoking and seal the air fryer shut. 
            The air fryer is NOT on, just sealed so the skewers can get a nice smokey taste. Leave it covered for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Then take it out of the air fryer and serve warm!</li>
     </ol>
