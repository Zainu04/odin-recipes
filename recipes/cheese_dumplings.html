        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>These Cheese Dumplings are a delicious, comforting dish filled with rich, creamy cheese wrapped in soft, pillowy dough. Perfect as a snack, appetizer, or side dish, 
            they combine the indulgent flavors of melted cheese with a tender, doughy exterior. Whether steamed or boiled, these dumplings are light yet satisfying, with the cheese 
            providing a gooey, savory filling in every bite. Serve them with a dipping sauce or a sprinkle of fresh herbs for added flavor. A perfect choice for cheese lovers or anyone 
            craving a warm, cheesy treat!</p>
    
         <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
         <ul>
            <li>1 cup cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>8 frozen dumplings</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>Chopped Parsley</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan</li>
         </ul>
    
         <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
         <ol>
            <li>To a frying pan over medium-high heat, add a generous splash of oil (I used 3 tablespoons to 1/4 cup). Once the oil is hot, add the frozen dumplings. Cook on one side until 
                beautifully golden and then flip over so the other side can crisp up, about 2-3 minutes each side. Once the dumplings are cooked, take out the pan.</li>
            <li>To the same pan over medium heat, oil the surface to avoid sticking if necessary and add the cheese in a layer to cover the whole pan evenly.</li>
            <li>Once the cheese starts melting, add the dumplings on top in a circular design so that the dumplings stick to the melting cheese.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking the cheese. First it will start to bubble and then it will start to turn golden and lose its stretchiness. Finally, you'll start to see parts of the cheese 
                turn a bit red or brown. When you shake the pan, the whole thing should move together as one piece and that's when it's done. Slide the cheese dumplings off the pan and onto 
                a plate gently.</li>
            <li>Garnish with chopped parsley and grated parmesan and enjoy! I love serving it with a dipping sauce like chipotle aioli or sweet chili sauce.</li>
         </ol>
