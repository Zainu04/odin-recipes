           homemade shawarma brings the authentic taste of the Middle East straight to your table. It's a delicious, easy-to-make

                <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>salt and black pepper</li>

                <p><h5>For the Sauce</h5></p>
                <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
                <li>2 tbsp tahini</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove, finely grated</li>
                <li>Salt and Pepper</li>

                <p><h5>For the Filling</h5></p>
                <li>Dill Cucumber</li>
                <li>Charred Capsicum slices</li>

           </uo>

          <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Start by placing the chicken thighs in the freezer for about 30 minutes, just until they are slightly firm. 
                This makes it easier to slice the meat thinly. Once partially frozen, remove the chicken and, using a sharp knife, 
                slice the thighs into thin strips. This step helps to create the perfect texture for grilling, but you can skip it 
                if you prefer.</li>
            <li>Transfer the thinly sliced chicken into a mixing bowl. Add the yogurt, smoked paprika, cardamom, cumin, coriander, 
                chili flakes, and cinnamon. Mince the garlic cloves and add them to the bowl along with the olive oil, salt, and 
                pepper. Use a microplane to zest the lemon, then squeeze in the juice. Stir everything well to coat the chicken 
                evenly. Cover and refrigerate the mixture for at least 2 hours, or up to 12 hours for deeper flavor.</li>
            <li>When you're ready to cook, take the chicken out of the fridge about 30 minutes beforehand to allow it to come to 
                room temperature. Preheat your grill or broiler to high. Line a baking sheet with foil and place an oven-safe rack 
                on top to catch any drips. Lightly grease the rack with olive oil, then spread the marinated chicken evenly over it, 
                making sure the pieces are not overcrowded. Grill the chicken for about 5 minutes per side, or until the edges are 
                nicely browned and crispy.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is grilling, prepare the garlic-tahini sauce. Simply combine the yogurt, tahini, and minced garlic 
                in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then mix until smooth. Set aside in the fridge until you’re 
                ready to serve.</li>
            <li>To prepare the pita, heat it either by wrapping it in foil and placing it in the oven or by briefly warming it over an 
                open flame for a few seconds—just enough to soften, not toast. Lay the warm pita flat on a surface, then spread a generous 
                amount of the garlic-tahini sauce across it. Add the fresh veggies, such as lettuce, bell peppers, and cucumber, followed by 
                the grilled chicken. Roll up the pita tightly, and serve immediately for a flavorful homemade shawarma!</li>
